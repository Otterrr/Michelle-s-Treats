# Michelle's Treats

Michelle is a baker, maker, creator, mother of 3 and the mother of my girlfriend. She paints, knits, crafts, gardens and of course bakes a variety of incredible snacks, cakes, biscuits and TREATS!

This website is a preliminary staging ground for selling her delicuious treats to the wider world. Michelle has already been selling her Treats through etsy and instagram marketing but through creating a website, she will have a base of operation to direct all of her interest to with information on herself, a gallery of all the tasty Treats and a place to request personalised packages.

# UX

## Project Goals

The primary goal of "Michelle's Treats" is to create a welcoming, attractive, *"functional"* website for Michelle to direct all her traffic from other social media sources (Etsy/Instagram/Facebook) to, in order to sell / discuss the selling of her Treats.

## Business Goals

Having been selling on Etsy and through friends of friends and family, and fine-tuning the box sizes and pricing of various treat bundles, Michelle is now ready to expand her business to a full-scale website to bring all of her outlets to one core place. This website will be the hub of all other social media sources, directing all interest hungry buyers to inspect mouth-watering pictures and competitive prices all in one place. This website is designed to eventually have all the variety of treats available as well as mix boxes and personalisable options for special occasions. This website will also give Michelle a much easier time of expanding to other exports such as Birthday Cakes and vegan, gluten free or keto Treats!

## Design Choices

The design for this website was simple. Make it modern and classy enough to attract a younger-more-computer-savvy audience, whilst also being clean and smart to attract those not too hot on the keys. It also needed to be welcoming, as Michelle is, it needed to reflect her. A nice mix of pale colours to contrast well with a Monochromatic header and footer scheme, whilst also matching potential colours of images of the Treats. Sharp angles, straight lines, clean cut, clearly showing the different sections from Header to Landing image to footer. Fonts/Colours TBC.

## Wireframes

The Wireframes were created using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA4L2BBhCvARIsAO0SBdZKeRLN-dlJkDnWv6KHNSZbivUxu8qMGqb8sbqJm_8n7Sw-QmrXjbEaAtdTEALw_wcB) and within each of them 3 more Wireframes were created for each of the potential user devices, phone, tablet and computer. The first Wireframe is the Landing page (HOME) With a nice large image of a mix box of Treats. It will also contain below it a couple more images of the top Treats that can be purchased from Michelle.

The 2nd Wireframe is the Gallery. A very important page for advertising food and drink, to entice the audience into purchasing. A simple, clean, full page gallery of the different Treats Michelle has to offer.

The 3rd Wireframe is the "About" page. This will contain two pieces of content. It will firstly contain a small blurb about Michlle and her baking career with an image of the Mastermind in the kitchen. Below this there will be a "Get in Touch" section, where those interested can request to Michelle what they would like in their Treat box or what they would like Michelle to construct for them if it has not yet been done. (Unlikely) Here, users will input their Name, Email and "Request", where they have a small box to ask for potential Treat ingredient they would like in their box and for what price/size they are looking for.

All 3 pages will have a consistent Header and Footer section, using the same font styles, sizes and colour schemes. They will have links below to Michelles Etsy store, Instagram page, Facebook page and a fictional Youtube channel, all consistent across each page.
